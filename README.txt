To set up the VScode as the text editor I follow the command line:
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
from the source: https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/associating-text-editors-with-git
which work perfectly
To create a new file use the function touch and write the name of the file and the type of the file(e.g: .py, .txt., etc)
